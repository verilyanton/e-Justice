							e-Justice Project
						</h1>
						<p>
							e-Justice is a service under development by Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory, which is based on the idea that artificial intelligence can substantially facilitate legal empowerment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Open Society Foundations define legal empowerment as '... strengthening the capacity of all people to exercise their rights...' and '... ensuring that law is not confined to books or courtrooms, but rather is available and meaningful to ordinary people.' In developing countries for many people, access to the basic human rights is limited by their legal literacy, because unlike those from developed countries, they cannot afford professional lawyer's help. Many human rights violations don't even reach the court, because people don't know that their rights were violated. On rare occasions when they do, there is a very small chance of winning because of corruption, a very small number of lawyers who are willing to work pro bono, and practical impossibility for legally illiterate people to defend themselves in the court.
						</p>
						<p>
							e-Justice aims to solve this problem. It is conceived as an automated legal advisor operating on the basis of the local, national and international legislation applicable to the requested jurisdiction, able to provide the most accurate legal test even to the least legally competent people.
						</p>
						<p>
							Using the service (as an app or online), anybody with a suitable device (preferably but not necessarily connected to internet), at any time, will be able to simulate trial on the issue of interest, passing information about the facts relevant to the case for analysis to e-Justice. Information entry is carried out via responses to very clear binary and multiple choice questions. e-Justice doesn't store legislation in textual form, but rather in the form of algorithms, i.e. as a system of logical premises, linked together in accordance with the meaning of the underlying legal clauses. After the analysis, e-Justice returns a disposition, which would mark the boundaries of the possibilities of the correct judicial decision on the case. If the decision of a real court goes beyond these boundaries, then it can be challenged as illegitimate, e-Justice being able to provide the complete list of references to the relevant pieces of legislation, which were violated by this decision. Users will be able to consider any legal issue regarding other jurisdictions as well. Besides the legal test, the constant improvement of the artificial intelligence employed in e-Justice will allow further delegation to the electronic justice the power of a preliminary trial, the result of which will be effective to the parties of the lawsuit.

							About AI Research Lab
						</h1>
						<p>
							Artificial Intelligence Research Laboratory is a non-profit community conducting research and development in the domain of artificial intelligence including natural language processing, machine learning, big data analysis, data mining, information integration, and related fields. The primary goal of the community is to advance human rights and liberties, democracy, good governance, transparency, legal empowerment, and quality of life in Eastern Europe, primarily focusing on the former Soviet countries. The community consists of the enthusiastic programmers, researchers, scientists, and 'isciplinary experts who dedicate their free time to tackle corruption, redundant bureaucracy, ineffective and inefficient public policies, mismanagement of public resources and other vital issues, which plagued East European societies in transition, with the power of AI.
